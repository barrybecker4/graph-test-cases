    <h1>How it works</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Enter the number of nodes and click on <span style="font-weight: bold">Generate Graph </span>button</li>
        <li>Choose whether it is a directed or undirected graph</li>
        <li>Drag and drop nodes to adjust their position</li>
        <li>To add an edge, click on the first node, then click on the second node</li>
        <li>
            To delete an edge, follow the same above step <br>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Note: </span> in the case of directed graphs, you have to click on the source node then on the destination node (in order)
        </li>
        <li>The test case follows the typical format in all graph problems:<br>
        The first line consists on two integers, "N M", where N is the number of nodes and M is the number of edges<br>
        M lines follow, each containing two integers "i j", meaning that there is an edge between node (i) and node (j).
        </li>
    </ol>

    <span style="color:red; font-weight: bold;">WARNING: </span> graphs with more than 100 nodes may be slow and more than 1000 nodes may freeze your browser.
